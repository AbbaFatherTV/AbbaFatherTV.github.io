                  The devotion to God Our Loving Father first came to our parish Don Bosco Shrine, Ayanavaram, Chennai in 2001. It was started by Ms. Vimala Padmaraj and team under the able guidance of the then  Most. Rt.Rev. Dr. Lawerence Pius, Bishop of Madras –Mylapore.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In 2008 a few people from the Ayanavaram Parish were invited by Ms. Vimala Padmaraj to attend a prayer meeting at the Divine Mercy Church, Annanagar led by a team from Bombay who were speaking on the devotion to God Our Loving  Father.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Touched and deeply drawn to this devotion, the call and desires of the Father, the 1st meeting of the Abba Father group, Ayanavaram was held at Dr. Barnabas’s house a parishioner of the Don Bosco Shrine with a few other members Ms. Vimala Padmaraj, Mr.Mukunthan, Mrs. Jillian Maclure, Mr. Russel, Mr. Michael and Mrs.Jacintha Joseph, Mr. Adrian & Mrs.Yolanda Vassou.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After much discussion and obtaining the permission of the then Parish Priest Fr. Amalraj Thomas, Sdb. The Feast day was celebrated for the first time in 2008 on the 1st Sunday on August 3rd, at the Don Bosco Shrine, Ayanavaram.
                </p>
                <p>
                  After the overwhelming response towards the novena and feast of God Our Loving father and drawn by the deep love towards the Father, the devotion became more prominent and spread to the faithful in other parishes nationally and internationally through our social Media.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Abba Father group has hence grown in Ayanavaram and the Feast Of God Our Loving Father is celebrated year after year, in fact for the past 12 years till date.

                  Who is Mother Eugenia, whom God the Father called <b>“My beloved daughter”</b>, <b>“My littleplant”</b>?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In our opinion, Mother Eugenia is one of the greatest lights of our times, the littleprophet of a new Church, in which the Father is the centre and apex of all mankind, and inwhich unity is the highest ideal of spirituality. She is a light given by the Father to the worldat this time of chaos and darkness, so that we may see the road that has to be followed.She was born in San Gervasiod’Adda (now Capriato San Gervasio), a small town in theprovince of Bergamo, Italy, on 4 September 1907, in a family of peasant background.She received only an elementary education. 
                  After a few years working in a factory, sheentered the Congregation of Our Lady of the Apostles at the age of 20 years. It was here thather great charismatic personality developed, leading to her election as Mother General of theCongregation at the age of only 25.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Quite apart from her spiritual qualities, her work in the social field alone would sufficeto ensure her a place in history. In twelve years of missionary activity she opened over 70center’s - each with infirmary, school and church - in the remotest spots of Africa, Asia andEurope.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It was she who discovered the first medicine for the cure of leprosy, extracting it fromthe seed of a tropical plant. This medicine was later studied and developed further at thePasteur Institute in Paris.
                </p>
                <p>
                  She encouraged the apostolate of Raoul Follereau, who, following in her footsteps andbuilding on the foundations laid by her, is regarded as the apostle of the lepers.During the period 1939-41 she conceived, planned and brought to fruition the project fora “Lepers’ City” at Azopte (Ivory Coast). This was a vast centre, covering an area of 200,000sq.m., for the care of leprosy sufferers.It remains even today one of Africa’s and the world’sleading centres of its kind.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In recognition of this achievement, France conferred the CouronneCivique, the highestnational honour for social work, on the Congregation of Missionary Sisters of Our Lady ofthe Apostles, of which Mother Eugenia was Superior General from 1935 to 1947.Mother Eugenia returned to the Father on 10 August 1990.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Her most important legacy to us is the Message of the Father (“The Father speaks to Hischildren”), the only private revelation made personally by God the Father and recognized asauthentic by the Church after ten years of the most rigorous examination. We reproduce at thebeginning of the text the statement issued by MgrAlexandreCaillot, Bishop of Grenoble,following the investigation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is noteworthy that the Father (in 1932) dictated the Message to Mother Eugenia inLatin, a language totally unknown to her.

                    IMPORTANT EXCERPTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF THE RIGHT REVEREND A. CAILLOT, BISHOP OF GRENOBLE, FOLLOWING THE REPORT PREPARED DURING THE CANONICAL ENQUIRY INTO THE CASE OF MOTHER EUGENIA.
                  </b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  “When Sister Eugenia made it known that she had been receiving apparitions of the Father, the investigating theologians replied that apparitions of the Father were in themselves impossible and that they had never occurred before in history. The sister held out against these objections, declaring simply: “The Father told me to describe what I saw. He asks His sons, the theologians, to search.” The nun never changed her testimony in any way. <span class="text-highlight-red">She maintained her statements over many months. It was not until January 1934 that the theologians discovered in St. Thomas Aquinas himself the answer to their objection.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The answer given by the great doctor of the Church about the distinction between apparition and mission was enlightening. It removed the obstacle which was paralysing the whole enquiry. Challenged by wise theologians, the uneducated little nun proved to be right. How, humanly speaking, could we explain, in this case too, the nun’s in-sight, wisdom and perseverance? A false visionary would have tried to adapt herself to the theologians’ explanations. <span class="text-highlight-red">The nun, however, held her ground. These are the additional reasons why her testimony seems trustworthy to us.</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                  In any case, what I find worthy of note is her reserved attitude towards the miraculous aspects of the case. While false visionaries give pride of place to extraordinary phenomena and even see nothing but these, Mother Eugenia, on the contrary, puts them second, as proofs, as means. There is no state of exaltation, but there is a balance of values which makes a favourable impression.”
